Tyler's Comments

2016.09.26 - Great work Julie! You've clearly put in time to understand
github and your work is well documented with comments. Most people made the
same mistakes in HW2 with the vocabulary, so take a look at the corrections
to see what I had in mind. I appreciate also your participation in class, so
keep it up!

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Really great work Julie. It looks like you put a lot of
effort into trying different things, which is the best way to learn to code!
I added some comments on how you might get your solution working and you should
keep in mind the dimension issue like in class (X <- out[,1] is only one
column). Keep up the good work!

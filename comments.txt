2016.09.26 - Great work Julie! You've clearly put in time to understand
github and your work is well documented with comments. Most people made the
same mistakes in HW2 with the vocabulary, so take a look at the corrections
to see what I had in mind. I appreciate also your participation in class, so 
keep it up!

#Week 2 - Second Assignment

####### Comment
# No worries Julie! I understood when designing the grading that this
# course would move to the bottom of your list of things to do. Do
# take a look at HW3, as functions and nested functions are important
# and difficult!

#I was very ill organized this week and I did not have time to do this
#problem set. I am sorry for this and will try to do it this week-end,
#knowing that it won't be considered as a "done" problem set :)
#See you !

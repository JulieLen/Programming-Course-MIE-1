# I've choosed the movie dataset

summary(movie[,"facenumber_in_poster"])

# The number of faces on the poster was computed using a
# algorithm for face recognition. Besides the strange value of 43, 
# it seems that most of the movies had posters displaying only 
# one face. 

summary(movie[,"title_year"])

#there is a great deal of movie here, but 50% where produced in the 
# 10 past years. 

summary(movie[,"imdb_score"])
#scores are over 10 so obviously all the grades are used. 
# Median and mean are around 6 and 50% of movies were attributed a grade
# between 5.8 and 7.2.
